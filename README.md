## 🙌 Inspiration and Attempt to Clone

This project is an attempt to recreate the design and functionality of [Digital Sahuji](https://www.digitalsahuji.com/).  
While this is not a perfect replica, it represents my effort to learn and apply concepts like:

- Responsive layouts
- Navigation between pages
- Using React components and Tailwind CSS for styling

Special thanks to the original website creators for their inspiring work!
